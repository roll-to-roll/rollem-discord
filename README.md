Add Rollem to your Discord Server (for server admins):  
[Primary Bot](https://rollem.rocks/invite/)
| [Beta Bot](https://rollem.rocks/invite/next/)

# Rollem Bot (for Discord)
A feature-filled dicebot that allows you to just roll. Rollem parses chat messages, and if it looks like a dice roll (`d20 to hit`), Rollem assumes it is, and produces a result. Messages can also be `rolled [d20 inline] with [2d4 multiple rolls]` or `6#4d6kh3 in bulk`.

Read more about available commands & syntax [on the website](https://rollem.rocks/docs).

## Primary Channel (`@rollem` | [invite](https://rollem.rocks/invite/))
The primary bot. If you aren't sure which to add, invite this one.

Changes are vetted in the Beta Channel before moving to this bot, so you should be insulated from change-related downtime.

## Beta Channel (`@rollem-next` | [invite](https://rollem.rocks/invite/next/))
The secondary bot, with earlier feature updates. Changes are vetted in the Beta Channel before being moved to the Primary Channel.

You may have both `@rollem-next` and `@rollem` in the same server, but they should not be allowed in the same channels.
