## Dice Syntax

X/Y/Z are integers. A and B are arbitrary Expressions.

| Syntax            |                                                                                                                                                          |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `XdY`             | Rolls X dice of Y size. `4d6` rolls 4 six-sided dice.                                                                                                    |
| `dY`              | Rolls a single die of Y size.                                                                                                                            |
| `dY!` `XdY!`      | Exploding dice. Rolling Y on a Y-sided die grants an additional die roll.                                                                                |
| `dY!Z` `XdY!Z`    | Exploding dice. Rolling Z or above on a Y-sided die grants an additional die roll.                                                                       |

| `A+B` `A-B`       | Arbitrary chains of addition and subtraction.                                                                                                            |
| `A*B` `A/B`       | Arbitrary chains of multiplication and division.                                                                                                         |
| `A++B` `A--B`     | Arbitrary chains of per-die addition and subtraction. Each value modifies each individual die roll. `4d6--2` rolls 4d6 with 2 subtracted from each.      |
| `(E)`             | Parenthetic expressions                                                                                                                                  |
| `A<<B`            | Counts the quantity of values in A that are lower than or equal to the value B. `10d6 << 3` counts the number of dice at 3 or below.                     |
| `A>>B`            | Counts the quantity of values in A that are greater than or equal to the value B. `10d6 >>4` counts the number of dice at 4 or above.                    |
| `A<B` `A>=B`      | Equality comparison on A and B. Must be the last operator (`(1 < 2) * 5` is invalid, `1 < (2 * 5)` is valid). Supported operators: `<` `<=` `>` `>=` `=` |
| `BX` `GX` `WX`    | Burning Wheel notation. Aliased to `Xd6 >> Y` where Y is determined by B/G/W. B=4, G=3, W=2.                                                             |
| `BX!` `GX!` `WX!` | Burning Wheel open roll notation. Aliased to `Xd6! >> Y` where Y is determined by B/G/W. B=4, G=3, W=2.                                                  |
| `dF` `XdF`        | Fate Dice notation. Rolls dice with values of -1, 0, 1. Represented by `-`, `0`, and `+`.                                                                |
| `XdYns`           | No Sort. Does not sort the result of `XdY` in the output.                                                                                                |
| `X#A`             | Evaluates the expression A X times. Use for stat generation: `6#4d6d1`                                                                                   |
| `dYdZ` `XdYdZ`    | Drop dice notation. Drops the *lowest* Z dice from the result of `XdY`. Alias for `XdYdlZ`. May be used with `ns` and `!`.                               |

## Limitations
* Rollem will not roll more than 100 dice.
* Rollem will not roll "one-sided" dice.
* Rollem will not roll single numbers.
* Pure math must be prefixed with `&` or `r`.
* Rolls prefixed with `N#` will be rolled `N` times. N > 100 will be ignored.

## Prefixing
Give Rollem a role of `rollem:prefix:<your prefix here>` to disable no-prefix rolling.

With this role:
* Rollem will still roll lines prefixed with `&` or `r`
* Rollem will still roll lines addressed to him. `@Rollem 2d20`
* Rollem will still roll inline syntax `swing the sword [2d20 for justice]`
* Rollem with not aggressively parse lines `2d20 for justice`
* Rollem will aggressively parse lines prefixed with `<your prefix here>`

## Preview Syntaxes
Give Rollem one of the following roles to enable different versions of the syntax for an entire guild:
- `rollem:beta` - use the unstable preview syntax for v1
- `rollem:v2` - use the in-development v2 syntax

Give a user one of the following roles to enable different versions of the syntax for that specific user (this overrides the above):
- `rollem:v1` - use the stable v1 syntax
- `rollem:beta` - use the unstable preview syntax for v1
- `rollem:v2` - use the in-development v2 syntax

# Development
## First-time setup
1. Set up [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
2. You will need an app bot user token from [discord's applications page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
3. You will need access to an initialized Postgres server. See [Setting up a database][#Local Database Setup] for details.
4. Rename and update `./secrets/sample-vscode.env`
  * You will need to replace `YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` with an app bot user token from [discord's applications page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)
  * The Application Insights line may be deleted to switch to console-only logging.
4. Run `yarn install` in the root directory
5. Link packages with `yarn bootstrap`
6. Build packages with `yarn build`

## Run Bot From VSCode (with debugging)
1. Rename and update `./secrets/sample-vscode.env`
2. Link packages with `yarn bootstrap`
3. Build with one of:
  * `yarn build:bot`
  * `yarn watch:bot` and allow it to idle in the background
4. Press F5 while the project folder is open. Launch configuration is in `.vscode/launch.json`

## Run Single Shard
1. Rename and update `./secrets/sample-vscode.env`
2. Run `yarn bootstrap`
3. Build with one of:
  * `yarn build:bot`
  * `yarn watch:bot` and allow it to idle in the background
4. Run `yarn run start:bot`

## Running Single Shard in Docker
1. You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. `yarn run package:bot` (The container will compile it)
3. `yarn run package:bot:start`

## Local Database Setup
1. You will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
2. Create database with `docker-compose up database`
3. Initialize the database
      1. `cd packages/common` to get to the common code directory
      2. `yarn install`
      3. `yarn run typeorm schema:sync` to sync the TypeORM schema

- You may have to repeat these steps when the schema changes
- Clear the database with `docker-compose down database` and then `docker-compose up database`
- To inspect the database you will likely want [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/)

# Language Development
Current version of the language is in `packages/language/src/rollem-language-2`.
1. `cd` into `packages/language`
2. Run `yarn watch` in one terminal
3. Run `yarn watch:test` in another terminal
4. Modify any file under `packages/language`
5. Test output is for `src/rollem-language-2/rollem.pegjs`

## ~~Local Kubernetes Development~~
These are incomplete and are a massive pain on Windows anyway.

1. Setup Minkube
  * [Windows-specific instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/#switch-between-windows-and-linux-containers))
  * [General instructions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/)
2. `minikube start` (may need to restart VSCode or your terminal first for it to find the command)
3. `kubectl cluter-info` confirm it's working
4. `minikube dashboard` open the dashboard
5. `eval $(minikube docker-env)` to setup for local running
6. `docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default` to get docker going on virtualbox
7. `docker build -t rollem-discord .` to build the current docker image

## Deploying the Bot

Summary
* [rollem-discord on docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lemtzas/rollem-discord/).
* Set the `DISCORD_BOT_USER_TOKEN` environment variable to your token from [discord's applications page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).
* The docker hub will automatically update with the latest commits on `master`.

### ~~Minimal Deploy (no storage)~~
Not currently possible.

1. Required tools
